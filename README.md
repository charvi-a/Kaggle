# Kaggle
Kaggle Competition to predict house prices

I worked on my first Kaggle competition to predict house prices using different regression techniques in Python.  

I used Decision Trees as well as an Elastic Net model(a regularized regression method that linearly combines L1 and L2 penalties of Lasso and Ridge methods) to predict house prices.  

Techniques used to improve the model:
- Hyperparameter tuning
- XGBoost
- RandomizedSearchCV
- Feature engineering(adding/dropping features when necessary)
- Logarithmic transformation
- Imputer
- One hot encoding and Label Encoder

I am currently still working on this competition.
